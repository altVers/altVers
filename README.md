# Hi, I'm Timofey Degtyarev! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸŒŸ
I'm 25 years old, and I'm a creative person striving to develop different aspects of my life. I find programming fascinating and promising, which is why I love learning about it. I have a wonderful wife and four cats that I love dearly.

## Experience and Skills ðŸ’»
In my work, I primarily use TypeScript and the React library. I also try to leverage other libraries that simplify development.
